## Solana COS On-Demand Sync API

### Overview
The **Solana COS On-Demand Sync API** allows users to copy blockchain archive data from Solana blockchain into their own Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) buckets.

## Getting Started

### 1. Grant Write Access to Our Service
To use the sync service, you must first grant write access to our systemâ€™s root ID on your Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) bucket.

#### Steps to Grant Write Access on Tencent COS:
1. Log in to your [Tencent Cloud Console](https://cloud.tencent.com/).
2. Navigate to **Cloud Object Storage (COS)** and select your bucket.
3. Open the **Permissions** settings -> Bucket ACL
4. Add our **Root ID** with **write access** to the bucket. **Root ID:** `TODO-ADD-ID`
5. Save the changes to apply the permissions.

> **Note:** If your bucket has public write access, no further action is required.

### 2. Initiate a Data Sync Request
Once the necessary permissions are in place, you can initiate a data sync by specifying the desired **start and end block numbers** along with your **Tencent COS bucket name** and **email address** for notifications.

#### Example Request using cURL
```sh
curl -X POST "https://getsolana-api.bwarelabs.com" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "startBlockNumber=1000" \
     -d "endBlockNumber=2000" \
     -d "userEmail=your@email.com" \
     -d "bucketName=test-bucket-6546465464"
```

### 3. Receive Notification
After the sync process completes, you will receive an email confirmation with details about the copied data. Ensure that the provided email address is valid and accessible.
